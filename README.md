# Lang-Chain Series Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the Lang-Chain Series Repository! This repository serves as a collection of knowledge and practice materials related to language models.

## API Creation

In this repository, we have developed APIs on top of two different Large Language Model (LLM) modules for specific tasks.

1. **Gemma Model for Essay API:**
   - This API utilizes the Gemma LLM module to generate essays based on input prompts.
   - Users can input prompts or topics, and the API generates corresponding essay content.

2. **LLMMA2 Model for Poem API:**
   - The LLMMA2 LLM module powers this API, which generates poems based on user input.
   - Users can provide prompts or themes, and the API produces poetic compositions.

## Chatbot Folder

### Ollama Usage

Within the `chatbot` folder, we utilize Ollama for running the LLM (Large Language Model) model in our local host environment. However, due to low system specifications, the latency or output time might be longer than expected.

- **Ollama:** Ollama is a tool that enables running large language models locally, including models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series.

### Issue with Low System Specifications

The performance issue related to latency or output time arises primarily from the limitations imposed by the system specifications. Since running LLM models requires significant computational resources, lower-spec systems may experience delays in processing.

#### Mitigating Latency Issues

To mitigate latency issues on low-spec systems, consider the following strategies:

- **Optimization:** Optimize the system settings and configurations to allocate resources efficiently.
- **Batch Processing:** Implement batch processing techniques to handle larger inputs efficiently.
- **Model Pruning:** Explore model pruning techniques to reduce the computational load without compromising performance significantly.
- **Hardware Upgrade:** Consider upgrading the system hardware to improve processing speed and efficiency.
