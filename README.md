# Lang-Chain Series Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the Lang-Chain Series Repository! This repository serves as a collection of knowledge and practice materials related to language models.

## Chatbot Folder

### Ollama Usage

Within the `chatbot` folder, we utilize Ollama for running the LLM (Large Language Model) model in our local host environment. However, due to low system specifications, the latency or output time might be longer than expected.

- **Ollama:** Ollama is a tool that enables running large language models locally, including models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series.

### Issue with Low System Specifications

The performance issue related to latency or output time arises primarily from the limitations imposed by the system specifications. Since running LLM models requires significant computational resources, lower-spec systems may experience delays in processing.

#### Mitigating Latency Issues

To mitigate latency issues on low-spec systems, consider the following strategies:

- **Optimization:** Optimize the system settings and configurations to allocate resources efficiently.
- **Batch Processing:** Implement batch processing techniques to handle larger inputs efficiently.
- **Model Pruning:** Explore model pruning techniques to reduce the computational load without compromising performance significantly.
- **Hardware Upgrade:** Consider upgrading the system hardware to improve processing speed and efficiency.
